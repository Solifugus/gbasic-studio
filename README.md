# gBASIC Studio

An IDE for gBASIC, written in gBASIC.

Studio is a separate project from the language. It depends on gBASIC the way any
application depends on its runtime — through the interpreter and its standard
library — and nothing in gBASIC depends on Studio.

## Status

**The model and persistence layer are built and tested; the interactive shell is
not.** Phases STU-0 through STU-5A are complete as libraries with 90 headless
test cases behind them. What exists on screen is a *view* that renders model
state: it has no signal handlers, so its buttons and tree rows do not respond to
clicks. Wiring input is the next work, and it is the largest untested surface —
every phase so far was verified headlessly or through self-terminating smoke
modes, so `gi.connect` on widgets, event dispatch back into the model, and
redraw-after-mutation have no coverage at all.

See `docs/gbasic_studio_design.md` for what Studio is meant to be, and
`docs/gbasic_studio_plan.md` for the phase sequence (STU-0..STU-11).

## Running it

```sh
./studio                      # gui mode, home at ~/.gbasic-studio
./studio gui ~/my-studio-home # explicit
./studio startup /tmp/probe   # a headless mode, prints the model summary
```

The launcher finds gBASIC through two overridable variables, both defaulting to
a sibling checkout:

```sh
GBASIC=/usr/local/bin/gbasic GBASIC_STDLIB=/usr/local/share/gbasic/stdlib ./studio
```

An empty home renders `(no workspace open)`, and since "New Project" is not yet
wired there is no way to create one from the UI. To see the shell with content
in it, build a canned workspace headlessly first:

```sh
./studio build /tmp/demo-home
./studio gui   /tmp/demo-home
```

## Tests

```sh
tests/run_studio.sh           # 90 cases, headless; honours GBASIC / GBASIC_STDLIB
```

Golden-file based: a driver plus a `.out` holding expected stdout, compared
byte-for-byte. The suite builds the sibling gBASIC first if `GBASIC` points into
a source tree, so an interpreter change is what gets tested rather than a stale
binary. Display tiers (`sections_gui`, `sessions_gui`, `results_gui`) SKIP
cleanly without GTK 4 or a display.

## Layout

```
app/studio.bas     entry point; dispatches modes (gui + the headless lifecycle)
lib/*.bas          the libraries — model, docs, sections, session, results, shell
tests/run_studio.sh
tests/drivers/     harness programs for the STU-3/4/5A tiers
tests/studio/      goldens
tests/helpers/     a shell helper for the signal-escalation case
docs/              design, phase records, and the GTK requirements survey
```

Libraries resolve through `GBASIC_PATH="lib:$GBASIC_STDLIB"`. The entry point
lives in `app/` rather than at the root deliberately: gBASIC also searches the
*importing file's* directory recursively, so an entry beside `lib/` would find
every library twice and warn about it.

## What Studio uses from gBASIC

Studio drove a lot of the platform work, and consumes it rather than
reimplementing it: `source_outline` (structural sections), `try_decode` (reading
JSON that may be corrupt without raising), `process.start`/`poll`/`read`/`stop`
(running a section in a child), `--line-buffered` and `print to error` (getting
that child's output promptly and separably), `atomic_replace` (crash-safe
writes), and the `persist`, `filetree`, `gtk`, `sourceeditor` and `gi` libraries.
